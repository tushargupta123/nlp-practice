marketing drives results with a focus on problems whenthe british ruled india, many indiansaccepted to work under their policy, and they did not try to rebel against the british fortheir presence in indian lands; they recognized the benefits of british rule. whatwas the factor that made indians accept thebritish government? the perception aboutbritish-policies (about trading, pay-scale, and positioning in the military) had beendone through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation, and many were ready to accept the british. so the marketing is like fire when smartlyhandled; it can destroy your enemies, but when not it can burn you.  marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product, price, place and promotion strategies. marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. these are ‘what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (w1)’, ‘what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer (w2)’, ‘what is your product promotion flow path (w3)’, ‘how much time it takes to convey product information to customer (h1)’. these criteria are what i call ‘3w1h’ forms. these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. however, are they enough? no. there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism (fm). generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. when it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, tv advertising and so forth. slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind. in the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question “what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities?” if the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3w1h, as discussed earlier. so let’s elaborate how 3w1h approach works along with feedback mechanism.           fig.1- 3w1h with fm process can target customer effectively          after deciding the customer range, you can work on otheractivities. since the customer isconscious about purchasing the product andwhen the product promoted, the first thing the customer will check is itsusefulness, and if his/her answer is ‘yes,’then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in themarket. therefore, one should present theproduct along with some unique thoughtand express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumermind. for example, the polio campaign inindia. the government had taken the initiative to make india polio-free byspreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums, in whichtelevision played a vital role. legendarycinema actor ‘amitabh bachchan’ was selected as an ambassador for this campaign.initially, the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinatingthe children within a fixed schedule. the advertisement circulated throughout the nation, andno stone was kept unturned by the governmentto make this campaign successful. however,much to the surprise, advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. this promotion failure was because ofnon-consideration of the customer (w1)and how advertise impacted its application on the customer (w2)? so after analysing failure, experts recommended changesin their marketing campaign like, to focus on major customer (here mainlyvillage woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv), type ofimpact on people (people who watched tv during that era, had an image ofamitabh as ‘angry young man’). so the campaignimproved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead ofhis soft-image, which used in the earlier campaign. so in a very next poliocampaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and whenfeedback is taken from people about such a sudden change, they replied that wedon’t want to watch ‘amitabh sir’ getting angry because of us.[i]inw3, organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer. currently,there are a lot of platforms available bywhich you can market your product. the mainagenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customerthrough marketing, at very first, if you make animpact on customer then only, he can show interest in your product. forexample, changes in launching trailers ofthe upcoming films. till 20thcentury television and newspaper were crucialfactors, but now along with television, marketing team take help of internetresources like youtube, facebook,introducing an article on the pre-trailer phenomenon. increasing the range of promotional devices, broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box-office.    forthe last factor (h1) time, the obvious question that comes to mind is that ‘is time for advertising matters?’, whilewatching the tv when an advertisement appears,many times we change the channel instead ofwatching the whole ad or ignore it altogether. you do have an option of ‘skip ad’ when you watch anything online, so one must decide how much time is requiredto deliver product information during itspromotion? delivering product informationin less time, may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so itcan result in attracting more customers. so, the content will be theking in the marketing. however, as onemust have guessed it, this will not work all the time. other factors like the cost of the product,application range, type of customer can also affectthe h1. for example, the customer would bemore conscious while watching higher-pricedproduct broadcast compare to the lower-priced one. so it would take more timefor the marketing team to convince thecustomer to buy the expensive good than the lower-priced one.afterimplementing a marketing strategy as per 3w1h, we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information aboutproduct image generated in customer’s minds through dealers and using feedback-form. not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving‘product sales target’ and can make the situation even worse. take the example of ‘the tata nano-making of world’scheapest car,’ which was mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects in indianautomobile industry. from the first phase of a marketingcampaign, tata nano was on so muchcontinuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american presidentbarack obama.[ii]the curiosity about the productwas so high that the sale of then-leadingcar model maruti-800 was dropped by 20% immediately after unveiling the nano.[iii]however, while marketing the product, an organization built “affordable, garibo ki car” image in customer’s mind,which made customers conscious about what will be their status-quo in societyafter buying nano? thus, they started giving preference to two-wheelers over nano. during the same time, some instances of nanos catching fire cameinto focus, which worsened the situation.this case even exacerbates when the teamdid not work on the feedback mechanismand hence, was not able to change customerperception about nano. later, when nano fire problem was technically sorted outbut even then, the marketing team did notmake any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car. therefore, customer’s negative perceptionremained stuck and the organization didnot even come close to achieving sellingfigures of nano. if the organization had usedfeedback mechanism, it would have been an entirely different story. so3w1h can be an essential factor whiledeveloping a marketing strategy for theproduct along with a reversible fmmethod. this method can help us tomonitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team tochange strategy whenever it goes into the wrongpath.[i]https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/delhi/when-amitabhs-voice-did-the-trick-to-make-india-polio-free/article6257123.ece[ii]  https://www.businesstoday.in/obamas-india-visit/nano-catches-worlds-most-powerful-mans-eyes/story/10144.html[iii]  https://www.businesstoday.in/obamas-india-visit/nano-catches-worlds-most-powerful-mans-eyes/story/10144.html
